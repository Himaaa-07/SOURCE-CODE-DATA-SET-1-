Description: heart.csv is a widely-used heart disease dataset for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients. It contains clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.

Key Features:

	•	age, sex, cp (chest pain type)
	
	•	trestbps (resting blood pressure), chol (serum cholesterol)
	
	•	fbs, restecg, thalach (max heart rate) 
	
	•	exang (exercise-induced angina), oldpeak, slope, ca, thal
	
	•	target (presence of heart disease)

Project Highlights:

	•	Data split into train and test sets, numeric features standardized.
	
	•	Models used: SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
	
	•	Evaluated via Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
	
	•	Visualizations: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importance plots, metrics comparison bar chart.
	
	•	Gradio interface allows users to input patient details and predict heart disease risk interactively.
